A quality-of-life addon suite for World of Warcraft 11.0.2+.

## Pre-release

Created by and for Singletail@Proudmoore-US, but feel free to use it, learn from it, or copy from it if you like.

Most of the code is highly optimized and built for speed. Lua is already incredibly fast, and doesn't really need optimization, but I do it for fun.

Font files might not follow all conditions of their licenses -- they will be fixed before official release.

## Feedback is welcome.
