A quality-of-life addon suite for World of Warcraft 11.0.2+.

## Pre-release

Created by and for Singletail@Proudmoore-US, but feel free to use it, learn from it, or copy from it if you like.

Most of the code is highly optimized and built for speed. Lua is already incredibly fast, and doesn't need this, but I do it for fun.

## Resources

If you are just learning how to write addons, these are the only resources you need:

- https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/World_of_Warcraft_API
- https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/

The vast majority of web sites are hopelessly outdated. Stick to these and you'll be fine.

## Fonts

This addon uses open-source fonts with custom glyphs added. You may want to install one or more at the system level if you want to modify the addon.

While all licenses for the fonts are being followed for usage, license files are not up to date -- they will be fixed before official release.

## Console

For easy access to the console, run your app with the '-console' switch. 

### MacOS:

open -a /Applications/World\ of\ Warcraft/_retail_/World\ of\ Warcraft.app --args -console

### Windows:

(Add -console as a switch in a shortcut to the executable.)

## Feedback is welcome.
